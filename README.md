## Intro to WebGL & Three.js

### WebGL
* JavaScript API for rendering interactive 2D and 3D graphics
inside an HTML `<canvas>` element.
* WebGL programs consist of control code written in mostly JS that is executed on a computer's Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)
* Best browser for WebGL : Chrome!   *(Firefox, Safari work too)*

### 3D Space
* Mesh : refers to the object's outer shape
* Camera
* Light
* Scene : everything you'll be seeing
* Renderer : the main processor that allows you to see your scene
* Other things: texture, shader, ...


### Three.js
* A library *for* the web graphics library (webGL)
* Important because it lowers the barrier of entry for WebGL
* Provides APIs for renderers, cameras, shaders, lighting, scenes, etc.
* Very new and doesn't have much documentation, but the actual API does abstract away the difficulty of WebGL itself
